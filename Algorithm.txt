Steps:
1) Augmentation performed on images
2) images sent to AlexNet for feature extraction
3) PCA performed on feature vectors to reduce dimensions
3.2) L2 normalization also performed on feature vectors
4) processed features passed to k-means to get cluster assignment for each image
5) cluster assignments used as pseudo labels for the AlexNet Classifier.
* Classification performed with cross-entropy loss.
6) model is trained for 500 epochs with the clustering happening only once per epoch.
